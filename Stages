Certainly! Here's a revised presentation of the stages, integrating our latest understanding and the chosen single-word names that reflect the increasing intellectual complexity and the number of variables involved:

Stage 1 - "Base" (MHC Levels 1 to 3, Beige):

Characteristics: Fundamental cognitive processes based on instinctual responses and basic sensory-motor skills.
Symbolized by: Triangle, representing the most elementary shape in cognitive development.
Stage 2 - "Formal" (MHC Levels 4 to 5, Purple):

Characteristics: Emergence of structured thinking, basic categorization, and early social understanding.
Symbolized by: Square, indicating an increase in complexity and the formation of more defined cognitive structures.
Stage 3 - "Dynamics" (MHC Levels 6 to 7, Red):

Characteristics: Development of individual agency, egocentric thinking, and the ability to form simple sentences and ideas.
Symbolized by: Tetrahedron, the simplest Platonic solid, reflecting a move towards three-dimensional cognitive processes.
Stage 4 - "System" (MHC Levels 8 to 9, Blue):

Characteristics: Establishment of logical operations, understanding of rules and order, and systematic thinking.
Symbolized by: Cube (Hexahedron), representing stability, uniformity, and a systematic approach.
Stage 5 - "Abstract" (MHC Levels 10 to 11, Orange):

Characteristics: Ability for abstract and strategic thought, hypothesis testing, and higher-order problem-solving.
Symbolized by: Octahedron, indicating an increase in cognitive facets and complexity.
Stage 6 - "Network" (MHC Levels 12 to 14, Green):

Characteristics: Advanced understanding of relationships, ethics, and interconnected systems.
Symbolized by: Dodecahedron, reflecting a network of intricate connections and a more complex cognitive structure.
Stage 7 - "Integration" (MHC Levels 15 to 17, Yellow/Turquoise/Coral):

Characteristics: Highest level of cognitive complexity, characterized by the integration and synthesis of multiple paradigms and systems.
Symbolized by: Icosahedron, representing the vast and integrated nature of cognitive processes at this stage.
