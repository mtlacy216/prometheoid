Beige (Survival/Sense) - MHC Levels 1 to 3:

Shape: Triangle
Spiral Dynamics Stage: Focus on basic survival, instinct-driven behavior.
Purple (Kin Spirits/Tribal Order) - MHC Levels 4 to 5:

Shape: Square
Spiral Dynamics Stage: Emphasis on kinship, tradition, and ancestral rituals.
Red (Power Gods/Egocentric) - MHC Levels 6 to 7:

Shape: Tetrahedron (Platonic Solid)
Spiral Dynamics Stage: Driven by power, dominance, and assertiveness.
Blue (Truth Force/Authoritarian) - MHC Levels 8 to 9:

Shape: Cube (Hexahedron, Platonic Solid)
Spiral Dynamics Stage: Guided by order, authority, and adherence to rules.
Orange (Strive Drive/Strategic) - MHC Levels 10 to 11:

Shape: Octahedron (Platonic Solid)
Spiral Dynamics Stage: Focused on achievement, success, and strategic thinking.
Green (HumanBond/Relativistic) - MHC Levels 12 to 14:

Shape: Dodecahedron (Platonic Solid)
Spiral Dynamics Stage: Valuing community, shared feelings, and caring for others.
Yellow/Turquoise/Coral (FlexFlow/Systemic to Meta-Cross-Paradigmatic) - MHC Levels 15 to 17:

Shape: Icosahedron (Platonic Solid)
Spiral Dynamics Stages:
Level 15 (Cross-Paradigmatic): Integrates concepts from multiple paradigms (Yellow).
Level 16 (Meta-Cross-Paradigmatic): Theorizes about multiple cross-paradigmatic systems, moving towards Turquoise.
Level 17: Develops theories or frameworks that integrate systems at an even higher level of complexity, aligning with Coral.
This adjustment provides a more nuanced representation of the higher levels of MHC, reflecting the advanced thinking and systemic integration characteristic of the Turquoise and Coral stages in Spiral Dynamics.
